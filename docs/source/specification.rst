PyPDF File specification
************************

The file generated by pypdfplot is both a PDF file and a Python file.
It would be more accurately to describe it as the intersection of both speficifications, i.e. a PyPDF file.

A PyPDF file can come in either Class I or Class II:

Class I
=======
A PyPDF file that is unedited, and therefore compliant with both PDF and Python file specification.

Class II-A
=========
A PyPDF file that has been saved (possibly after edits) by a PDF compliant writer. The '#' in the header at 0x0000 will be gone and the generating script will not appear first in the file anymore, but the offsets in xref table will still be correct. This file cannot be ran as Python script without alteration. The Python script can be retrieved via the /PyFile key in the trailer.

Class II-B
=========
A PyPDF file that has been saved (likely after edits) by a Python editor. It should be expected that the offsets in the xref table and the xrefstart address are not pointing to the right locations anymore. As it may be assumed that only the Python script has been edited, the offset difference can be retrieved from the difference betwen the filesize entry after the %%EOF trailer and the actual filesize.

A PyPDF reader should be able to read Class I, Class II-A, and Class II-B files.
A PyPDF writer should only write Class I files.
