- Finish documentation on readthedocs
- Finish the fix_pdf function; This is mainly reorganisation of the read function:
	*Try to read filesize trailer
	*If it passes, this is Class I or IIA - correct offsets and read as Class I
	*If not, try to read as Class IIB file, i.e.: read as pdf-only and get pyname
         from /PyFile in root object
	*Extract files and mark pyfile as such. Decode if necessary.
- Install pypdf_fix binary in the Python/Scripts directory.
- Dynamic versioning
- Have a serious look at licencing
