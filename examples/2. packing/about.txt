In this example we rely on external libraries and external data for the plot.
The external data must be packed into the PDF in order to be truly portable.
The packed files are extracted whenever the script is ran again.

Note that plt.pack() is used designate files for packaging in the output PDF file.
the keyword "in_place" is set to False, meaning that the original packing.py file will not
be removed after the publish() function is called.

By uncommenting plt.cleanup() all embedded files (in this case, data.xlsx and title.txt), will
be removed after the publish() function is called. In combination with setting in_place to True,
this leaves only the output packing.pdf function. By renaming this to packing.py and uncommenting 
plt.cleanup(), all the originial source files are recovered.
