Overview
************

The ``pypdfplot`` package provides a backend to ``Matplotlib`` that generates a PDF file of the plot with the generating Python script embedded.

Although ``Matplotlib`` is a very powerful and flexible plotting tool, once a plot is saved as PNG or PDF file, the link between the plot and its generating Python script is lost. The philosophy behind ``pypdfplot`` is that there should be no distinction between the Python script that generates a plot and its output PDF file, much like there is no such distinction in an Origin or Excel file. As far as ``pypdfplot`` is concerned, *the generating script* **is** *the plot.*

When the backend is loaded and a figure is saved using ``plt.savefig()``, the generating Python script is embedded into the output PDF-file in such a way that when the PDF file is renamed from .pdf to .py, the file can be read by a Python interpreter without alteration. The script can then be edited at will to implement changes in the plot, after which the script is ran again to produce the updated PDF file of the plot -- including the updated embedded generating script.

The resulting file, which is both a Python file and a PDF-file, is conveniently called a PyPDF-file.

Quickstart
************

The ``pypdfplot`` package provides a backend for ``Matplotlib`` for producing PyPDF-files.
This section goes through a basic example that shows how to use ``pypdfplot``.

Simple Example
==============

For this example, the goal is to produce a red plot of the quadratic function from -10 to 20.
To start off, you first plot this in the conventional way using ``Matplotlib``.

Create a new python file, let's call it ``example.py``. 

Open the file and enter the following script:

.. code:: python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    
    x = np.arange(-10,20,0.1)
    y = x**2
    
    plt.plot(x,y,'r')
    plt.savefig('example.pdf')
	
After running this script, you should get the following figure:

.. image:: https://pypdfplot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/plot.png

To produce a PyPDF-file, all you have to do is add a line on the top to import the backend: 

.. code:: python

    import pypdfplot.backend
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    
    x = np.arange(-10,20,0.1)
    y = x**2
    
    plt.plot(x,y,'r')
    plt.savefig(example.pdf)

After running this script, if you look in the folder where the ``example.py`` file once was, you'll notice it has been replaced by a new file ``example.pdf``.
Of course the fact that the ``example.py`` file disappeared doesn't mean the script is gone -- it is now embedded in the PyPDF file ``example.pdf``!

You can find evidence of this by opening the ``example.pdf`` file:

.. image:: https://pypdfplot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/plot_pdf.png

The table on the left shows all files that are embedded, and clearly ``example.py`` is there.

Most versions of Acrobat reader don't allow the embedded .py file to be opened for security reasons.
To access the python script, rename ``example.pdf`` to ``example.py`` and open the file.
This is what you should find:

.. code:: python

    #%PDF-1.3 23 0 obj << /Type /EmbeddedFile /Length 124 >> stream
    import pypdfplot.backend
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    
    x = np.arange(-10,20,0.1)
    y = x**2
    
    plt.plot(x,y,'r')
    plt.savefig('example.pdf')
    
    """
    endstream
    endobj
    1 0 obj
    
    <...>
    
    startxref
    8829
    %%EOF
    0000009410
    PyPDF
    """

The first line is the PDF header that helps the PDF reader to determine this is a valid PDF file.
It also includes the object header for the EmbeddedFile object of our ``example.py`` file. 
This line may not be altered, as it will result in corruption of the PyPDF file.

What follows is the original python script, followed by a large multiline string. 
This multiline string contains all the PDF objects including the data for any remaining embedded files (see `PyPDF File specification`_).
Making any edits in this string will again likely result in corruption of the file, so it is strongly discouraged.

In between the first line and the multiline string is the original python script, which may be edited in any way.
For example, let's give the plot a title and change the color to blue:

.. code:: python

    #%PDF-1.3 23 0 obj << /Type /EmbeddedFile /Length 124 >> stream
    import pypdfplot.backend
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    
    x = np.arange(-10,20,0.1)
    y = x**2
    
    plt.plot(x,y,'b')
    plt.title('Blue Example')
    plt.savefig('example.pdf')
    
    """
    endstream
    endobj
    1 0 obj
    
    <...>
    
    startxref
    8829
    %%EOF
    0000009410
    PyPDF
    """
	
Again, after running the script the ``example.py`` file is replaced by the ``example.pdf`` file.
When you open ``example.pdf``, you should find the updated blue plot with caption:

.. image:: https://pypdfplot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/plot_pdf2.png

*savefig()* keywords:
---------------------
The behaviour of the *plt.savefig()* function can be altered through the use of the following keywords. 
Default values are given in brackets.

- **output_fname** (*str*) default = *None* -- Filename of the output file. If *None*, the filename of the python file is used with extension .pdf.

- **file_list** (*list*) default = *[]* -- List with filenames that will be embedded in the PyPDF-file. The generating script is added separately and should not be included here.

- **cleanup** (*bool*) default = *True* -- Whether or not to cleanup files that have been embedded in the PyPDF file. Set to *False* and run script to extract embedded files.

- **multiple** (*str*) default = *'pickle'* -- How to handle multiple plots in a single generating script. Can be any of *'pickle'*, *'add_page'*, or *'finalize'*. See section XXX for more details

- **force_pickle** (*bool*) default = *False* -- Pickles the figure and embeds a Python script that unpickles and reads the figure again. This can be useful when dealing with very large source files, see section XXX for more details.

- **verbose** (*bool*) default = *True* -- Wether or not to show verbose comments during publication.

- **prompt_overwrite** (*bool*) default = *False* -- Wether or not to prompt when the output file already exists and is about to be overwritten. If *False* and the output file does already exist, ``pypdfplot`` will overwrite the file if possible.
  
- **kwargs** -- Any other keyword arguments are passed to matplotlib's *savefig* function.


Embedding Files
===============

In many cases you may want to plot data that is stored in a separate file.
In order for this to work, the external data file must be included in the PyPDF file as well.
What follows is an example how to embed external files with ``pypdfplot``.

We will write a script that opens data from an external excel file and reads the title and axis label from an extrnal text file.

Create an excel file called ``data.xlsx``.
For this example, fill the file with the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence:

.. image:: https://pypdfplot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/excel_data.png

Then create a text file with our title and axis labels called ``title.txt``:

.. image:: https://pypdfplot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/notepad_title.png

Finally, create a new python file called ``packing.py``. 

As before, let's first have a look at how this script would look without the ``pypdfplot`` backend.
We will use ``Pandas`` to import the Excel file into Python.
Open ``packing.py`` and enter the following script:

.. code:: python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import pandas as pd
    
    df = pd.read_excel('data.xlsx')
    plt.plot(df.x,df.y,'r.')

    with open('title.txt','r') as f:
        title = f.readline()
        xlabel = f.readline()
        ylabel = f.readline()

    plt.title(title)
    plt.xlabel(xlabel)
    plt.ylabel(ylabel)

    plt.savefig('packing.pdf')

After running this script, the following figure should pop up:

.. image:: https://pypdfplot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/plot2.png

In order to use ``pyplotpdf`` to save the figure as a PyPDF file, change add the import for *pypdfplot.backend* as before.
Additionally, you must make sure that the embedded files are available for the python script when it is run again next time.
To do this, the embedded files must be extracted before they are read, ideally even before matplotlib is loaded.
This can be done by importing *pypdfplot.backend.auto_extract* instead of just *pypdfplot.backend.auto_extract*

Additional files can be embedded in the PyPDF file by appending their filenames to a list and passing the list to *plt.savefig()* as the *file_list* keyword argument.

By setting the keyword *cleanup = True* in the *plt.savefig()* function, the local files will be deleted after they are successfully embedded in the PyPDF file.

The script now looks as follows:

.. code:: python

    import pypdfplot.backend.auto_extract
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import pandas as pd
    
    df = pd.read_excel('data.xlsx')
    plt.plot(df.x,df.y,'r.')

    with open('title.txt','r') as f:
        title = f.readline()
        xlabel = f.readline()
        ylabel = f.readline()

    plt.title(title)
    plt.xlabel(xlabel)
    plt.ylabel(ylabel)

    plt.savefig('packing.pdf',
                file_list = ['data.xlsx',
                             'title.txt'],
                cleanup = True)

After running the script, the output file ``packing.pdf`` is generated and all three files ``packing.py``, ``data.xlsx``, and ``title.txt``, are deleted after being embedded in ``packing.pdf``.
This can be confirmed by opening ``packing.pdf``:

.. image:: https://pypdfplot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/plot_pdf3.png

To maximize integration with ``Matplotlib``, the PyPDF file is checked for embedded files at the time the ``pypdfplot`` package is imported. If embedded files are found, they are extracted provided there are no local files with the same filename. If a local file is found with the same filename, it is assumed this is a more recent version (e.g. a file that was extracted and then updated), and should therefore have precedence over the embedded file.

In case you want to keep the files that are extracted from the PyPDF file, simply set the keyword *cleanup = False*.

Editing Embedded Files
======================

There are two ways embedded files can be edited or updated: The Python way or the PDF way. Editing files via the Python way is encouraged, but using PDF should also work.

The Python way
--------------

#) Exctract all embedded files from the PyPDF file by renaming the file to the .py extension, and running the Python script with the *cleanup* keyword set to **False**.

#) Edit the local file

#) Run again to embed the updated files. If so desired, the *cleanup = True* keyword can be used again to remove all local files.

When ``pypdfplot`` tries to exctract the outdated files from the pypdf file, it will check for local copies. If a local copy is present, it will assume it is a more recent version and will not extract the outdated embedded file.

The PDF way
-----------

#) In the PDF viewer (in most cases, this is Adobe Acrobat), double click on the embedded file you wish to edit to open it. 

#) Edit the file and save it. It will be saved as a local copy in the PDF viewer.

#) Save the PDF file

#) Because the PDF file was saved by a viewer that is unaware of the PyPDF file format, the format is severed. Assuming your filename is ``pdf_file.pdf``, run the following script to convert the PDF file back to PyPDF:

.. code:: python

    from pypdfplot import fix_pypdf
    fix_pypdf('pdf_file.pdf')

alternatively, the command-line tool can be used:

.. code:: bash

    fix_pypdf pdf_file.pdf
